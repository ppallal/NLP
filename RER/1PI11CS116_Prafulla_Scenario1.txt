<Salesperson> May i help you sir ??
</Salesperson>
<Customer>  Yes, I was looking for phone to buy
</Customer>
<Salesperson> Ok , you have come to the right place
</Salesperson>
<Salesperson>Do you already have anything in mind ??
</Salesperson>
<Customer>  not exactly!, I have just seen the advertaisements of Nokia Lumia.
</Customer>
<Customer>Could you suggest me any better phones?
</Customer>
<Salesperson> Ok . Nokia Lumia is a great phone
</Salesperson>
<Salesperson>It has lots of models also
</Salesperson>
<Salesperson>Can i know your budget ??
</Salesperson>
<Customer>  don't care about money  </Customer>
<Customer>consider it a an unrestricted budget
</Customer>
<Salesperson> What features are you looking for
</Salesperson>
<Salesperson>and what are ur feature priority
</Salesperson>
<Salesperson>??
</Salesperson>
<Customer>  well, I am a wild life photographer.
</Customer>
<Salesperson> Oh thats nice
</Salesperson>
<Customer>  so having a good camera will be my first priority.
</Customer>
<Salesperson> Ok i will keep that in mind
</Salesperson>
<Customer>  also it needs to have a good battery life
</Customer>
<Customer>since i roam around in the jungle, a GPS would help me a lot in locating myself.
</Customer>
<Customer>other than that nothing much 
</Customer>
<Customer>but
</Customer>
<Customer>having more and more features is always better
</Customer>
<Salesperson> ok considering your requirements i will suggest you some phones
</Salesperson>
<Customer>  okay ?
</Customer>
<Salesperson> There is Nokia Lumia 1520
</Salesperson>
<Salesperson>Google Nexus 6
</Salesperson>
<Salesperson>and Samsung Note 4
</Salesperson>
<Salesperson>All of them meets your requirement to a great extent ??
</Salesperson>
<Customer>  can you compare them for me with respect to my requirements
</Customer>
<Salesperson> Sure .
</Salesperson>
<Salesperson> Camera wise , Lumia wins here
</Salesperson>
<Salesperson>It has a really good 20Mp camera
</Salesperson>
<Salesperson>while Nexus has 13Mp and Note 4 sport a 16Mp camera
</Salesperson>
<Salesperson>However all of them has HD recording
</Salesperson>
<Salesperson> But again the video resolution is better in nexus and note when compared to lumia
</Salesperson>
<Customer>  How about the OS? i have heard Lumia sucks compared to Android
</Customer>
<Salesperson> ABSOLUTELY NOT ! Its a myth rather than a fact .
</Salesperson>
<Salesperson> I myself have a lumia and it can do everything a Android phone do
</Salesperson>
<Salesperson>The Windows OS in Lumia is really Userfriendly and the UI is better than Android .
</Salesperson>
<Customer>  Oh that is good to know
</Customer>
<Customer>But, Could you elaborate on the GPS aspect.
</Customer>
<Salesperson> GPS wise all are same .
</Salesperson>
<Salesperson> Lumia by default has a HERE map where as other two has Google maps.
</Salesperson>
<Salesperson> Considering the fact you won't be getting network always , i suggest to go with lumia here . The HERE maps works really well when you are offline
</Salesperson>
<Salesperson>You can Navigate and search without any problem
</Salesperson>
<Customer>  that is good.
</Customer>
<Customer> do u think i would need to consider any other feature?
</Customer>
<Salesperson> Battery life as you mentioned earlier
</Salesperson>
<Salesperson>in that case again i suggest Nokia Lumia
</Salesperson>
<Salesperson> It has a 3400mAh battery , with 27hrs talktime
</Salesperson>
<Salesperson>and 760hrs standby time
</Salesperson>
<Salesperson> whisch is better than other two .
</Salesperson>
<Salesperson>Sir , are you confused , you are taking time to reply ??
</Salesperson>
<Customer>  oh sorry i was just having coffee
</Customer>
<Customer>so, Lets come to a conclusion.
</Customer>
<Customer>If u were in my place what would u buy?
</Customer>
<Salesperson> Ok , no problem'
</Salesperson>
<Salesperson>Considering our discussion till now , Its cleary Nokia lumia 1520
</Salesperson>
<Customer>  Thank you for your support
</Customer>
<Customer>I am obliged.
</Customer>
<Customer>Can you book a Nokia Lumia 1520 for me?
</Customer>
<Salesperson> Sure
