What features are you looking for
and what are ur feature priority
??
niraj â€¢ 29 mins
well, I am a wild life photographer.

niraj goel
Oh thats nice
niraj â€¢ 28 mins
so having a good camera will be my first priority.
28 mins
Prafulla Pallal
niraj goel
Ok i will keep that in mind
niraj â€¢ 28 mins
also it needs to have a good battery life
since i roam around in the jungle, a GPS would help me a lot in locating myself.
other than that nothing much 
but
having more and more features is always better
26 mins

niraj goel
ok considering your requirements i will suggest you some phones
niraj â€¢ 24 mins

niraj goel
There is Nokia Lumia 1520
Google Nexus 6
and Samsung Note 4
All of them meets your requirement to a great extent ??
niraj â€¢ 22 mins
can you compare them for me with respect to my requirements
22 mins
Prafulla Pallal
niraj goel
Sure .
Camera wise , Lumia wins here
It has a really good 20Mp camera
while Nexus has 13Mp and Note 4 sport a 16Mp camera
However all of them has HD recording
But again the video resolution is better in nexus and note when compared to lumia
niraj â€¢ 18 mins
How about the OS? i have heard Lumia sucks compared to Android
16 mins
Prafulla Pallal
niraj goel
ABSOLUTELY NOT ! Its a myth rather than a fact .
I myself have a lumia and it can do everything a Android phone do
The Windows OS in Lumia is really Userfriendly and the UI is better than Android .
niraj â€¢ 14 mins
Oh that is good to know
But, Could you elaborate on the GPS aspect.
13 mins
Prafulla Pallal
niraj goel
GPS wise all are same .
Lumia by default has a HERE map where as other two has Google maps.
Considering the fact you won't be getting network always , i suggest to go with lumia here . The HERE maps works really well when you are offline
You can Navigate and search without any problem
niraj â€¢ 9 mins
that is good.
 do u think i would need to consider any other feature?
8 mins
Prafulla Pallal
niraj goel
Battery life as you mentioned earlier
in that case again i suggest Nokia Lumia
It has a 3400mAh battery , with 27hrs talktime
and 760hrs standby time
whisch is better than other two .
Sir , are you confused , you are taking time to reply ??
niraj â€¢ 2 mins
oh sorry i was just having coffee
so, Lets come to a conclusion.
If u were in my place what would u buy?
2 mins
Prafulla Pallal
niraj goel
